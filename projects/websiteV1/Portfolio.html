<h1 id='welcome'>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>

<h2 id='welcome2'>Let me introduce myself a little and explain how I got into web development.</h2>

<p id='citizen'> <code>(Just for the reference, I am a <b><u>US CITIZEN.</u></b> Therefore, NO sponsor visa is needed.)</code></p>

<p id='intro'>
      I am currently looking for my first job as a junior front-end web developer. I am a newbie in the web development industry. Since I started to learn HTML at the end of December of 2019, I fell deeply into web development and never stopped learning since then! My very first project was made for the company I work at, and it has help many employees like me to increase our productivity rate. You can find those projects in <a href='Projects.html' target='_blank'>Projects</a> tab above.
</p>
<p id='intro'>
    I wasn't hired as a developer when I made those projects. I was just another regular agent doing the same work as other agents until I became a team lead, which still has nothing to do with coding. As a team lead, I always pondered how I could help my team to increase productivity rate, and how they can utilize better resources to comprehend things more effectively. Because it was a newley introduced project, everything was in a chaotic state. Information weren't clear, training was close to non-existent, and softwares were very inefficient to use.
</p>
<p id='intro'>
    Amidst the chaos, I remember the time when I was running shopify online business. During that brief period of time, I had encountered the concept of HTML very briefly. And I knew HTML can be very helpful to create an organized guide to help my team. So I bought a book called <i>HTML&CSS</i> written by <i>Jon Duckett</i>  from Amazon and started reading it whenever I had free time. And this is how I built my <a href='FBT.html' target='_blank'>very first project</a> using regular <i>Notepad.exe</i> in Windows. It was a simple project that displays protocols for my department in more organized way.
</p>
<p id='intro'>
    After finishing <a href='FBT.html' target='_blank'>first project</a>, I immediately started on <a href='projects.html' target='_blank'>second project</a> (CNG). This was rather a very big project for me as a newbie, and I spent so much time and learned so much about web development, especially on JavaScript. This project is to restructure template-note-creator that our department uses after every case we handle. I'm still updating this project as our protocol changes time to time. You can also see all the changes I made by pressing [alt] + [u] from the project. Although it hasn't been officially approved for all CVS, it has been approved for my department and many people are using it.
</p>
<p id='intro'>
    Long story short, as I learned more about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript works, I fell deeply into web development. I always used websites, but never knew how to create one. The fact that I can make a content that the whole world can use has attracted me to fall deeply into web development. As a self-taught web developer, I went through a lot of challenges and adversities. However, the satisfaction I get from problem solving and seeing completed project was far greater that I started to spend most of my free time coding. 
</p>
<p id='intro'>
    I've been in insurance field for basically my whole working career, but I always knew that it's not going to be my ultimate career path to pursue after. I was always lost in the concept of having passion, life goal, etc, because I didn't know what I truely wanted to do. However, now I'm content that I finally found my passion and I want to fully dedicate myself into web development. I want to eventually become a full stack developer and maybe even a game developer in far future. I know I have a very long way to go, but I'm passionate about learning more to get better everyday. Most importantly, I know for a fact that this career is definitely not going to be just a get-paid-to-survive job like it has always been for me with past jobs. Thus, I will never give up, more like I can't give up because this is too fun!
